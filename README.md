# Reproductive Health and Climate Change

## Abstract

Many don’t realize it but contraceptives and family planning have a giant impact on reducing our planet's carbon emissions, 20 times more of an impact than things like recycling or driving an efficient car, because…well... humans are responsible for most carbon emissions. Using worldwide contraceptive data, I'm creating an interactive map to pinpoint areas that are lacking contraceptive information and resources so we can better help these communities as well as the planet. <!--- is this really the purpose? To identify areas that lack contraceptive info? I think there is more that can be accomplished with this -->

## Context

### The problem
One of our world's largest problems right now is climate change. The huge amount of carbon humans are currently pumping into our atmosphere is having catastrophic effects. Floods, massive fires, extreme weather/storms, and higher temperatures than ever seen before (to name a few) <!---fragment, consider revising-->. Many people find themselves wanting to save the planet but many of the things we can do don't have much of an impact. A select group of people driving fuel efficient cars can’t begin to cover the carbon emissions released by large companies. Large companies are responsible for most of the carbon emissions our world is facing and many things individuals do don't end up having much of an effect. <!---why highlight large companies if this isn't your focus? -->

### Why is this important to solve?
One solution that can actually make a huge impact is not having as many children. This is in no way a request for people to no longer have kids, but if you don't want children right now, you shouldn't be having them. Scientists predict that family planning and the education of girls could prevent the release of 119.2 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere <!--- be more specific. How much education? What do you mean by family planning? -->. This can not only help the planet but is also important for women who, for centuries, have not had control of their bodies <!--- awkward sentence. Consider revising -->. Better access to contraception and education will provide families (but specifically women) better agency over their lives and bodies and can help save the planet too.

<!--- I think you will be more effective here if you stick to one issue (e.g., less children leads to less carbon) and avoid drifting into commentary on body autonomy unless you intend to use data to say something about it -->

## Proposal 

## Specific question I'm trying to answer
How can we help get different regions the contraception access they deserve? <!--- I don't think this is actually your question. If it is, how is the data going to help you answer it? --> Right now, we know family planning would have a huge effect on climate change but don’t have a way to get the ball rolling. What areas need resources in the first place? <!--- this seems closer to your question --> Being able to pinpoint specific areas that need care would be helpful and creating a resource for people to learn about the cause and fund specific areas would be even better. The connection between family planning and carbon emissions will mostly be supported by theory but I'm willing to try to make a case with data if there is enough time. <!--- don't hedge -->

### How I will answer it
I hope to use a mix of R Studio and possibly Tableau and Python to make an interactive resource (currently planning on a shiny app) that uses color to indicate a certain region's family planning resources. Viewers will be able to see what areas are lacking support and the app will provide them with information and easy ways to fund better reproductive health care resources.

### What I expect/hope to find
It's hard to say exactly what countries will have more issues than others, but I expect that countries with free healthcare and less misogyny will also have less issues providing contraceptive care to their citizens. I hope that this will be illuminating for how terrible the reproductive care in the USA is. With any luck, this will act as a wake up call that we have issues to fix at home before we start trying to solve other countries problems.

<!--- are you focused on the US or World wide? I'm confused -->

## Conclusion

### Summary
Overall, our world's carbon emissions are getting out of control and many are left feeling like there isn't much they can do to stop it. Many environmentally friendly choices (like composting or purchasing eco-friendly products) aren't accessible to all and do not meaningfully impact carbon emissions. In contrast, better family planning and allocation of educational resources is something individuals can fund right now that actually makes a measurable impact. An interactive heatmap will give people a way to find out what countries need the most support in giving their citizens proper reproductive health care and a way to take action. 

### How my solution could be important beyond this specific context
This app set up could be applied to other country-based data. You could, for example, see which countries are suffering the most from food poverty or certain illnesses. I think this topic is already fairly generalized and quite a large scope (which will likely have to be narrowed) so expanding to an even more general concept doesn't seem feasible.

<!--- Think about how your interactive heatmap might be useful in other contexts, not how the tech could be applied to other data -->

### Limitations and potential future directions
The biggest issue with this topic is that its data is interesting but pretty fuzzy. There's no clean data set that displays how each child born directly relates to an increase in carbon emissions. This project will have to be theory based and mainly focused on identifying areas that need support. It will also be difficult to find ways to support different regions. I expect the final version of this project to be clean and polished, however, I'm not opposed to having this app be a launching point for further resources and research on how to help the planet with family planning and education.
  
<!--- let's plan to add the ability to adjust assumptions into your shiny app -->
